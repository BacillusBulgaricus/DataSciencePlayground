    "The purchase of a particular product in this analysis is considered an independent event, i.e, not necessarily dependent on or influenced by the purchase of another product.

    "This analysis provided the following insights to answer the third marketing question. Most products purchased more than once are concentrated in the segments targeted at dog and cat owners. The total sales figures for cat and dog products exceed nearly six times the sales for bird and fish products. The darker green shades on the heat map identify the top sales by product category and by pet type. The sales of cat and dog products deliver above-average performance in nine out of eleven product categories, with top three categories for cat products being Equipment, Food, and Toys, and the top three product segments for dogs being Equipment, Snack, and Medicine. The top sales for bird and fish products come close only to the 50th percentile of total sales. The pet types bird and fish share the same top three product categories ‚Äî Equipment, Snack, and Toys."

    "By exploring the data to provide answers for the marketing team of PetMind regarding its new planned service Pet Box Subscription, I gained the following insights. To include _only_ products that were purchased more than once in the PetMind stores in the last year in the list of products for the new subscription service is not justified by the provided analysis of the sales data. Most product sales of PetMind are generated by products targeted at dog and cat owners, and these sales are spread among a wide product portfolio. Concentrating on just products that were purchased more than once and including bird and fish products with a high likelihood of repurchases will have an unfavorable impact on the success of the new service, and in effect also on the company's profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend starting the Pet Box Subscription service by targeting dog and cat owners with offers of a broader range of products/services. Before making a final decision on the list of products for the subscription service, I would conduct a customer survey to inquire about customer inclinations to utilize such services, and about customers' preferences on subscription customization. I would design the subscription product list in a way to provide the customers with an option to personalize their Pet Box Subscription. This would lead to better customer satisfaction and to more loyal customers, which is the main intent of the introduction of the subscription service. After the launch of the service and evaluation of its initial performance and results, I would consider expanding the offer also to products and services for the more marginal pet types ‚Äî bird and fish. But initially, the main focus of the new Pet Box Subscription should be on the top-tier pet types which generate the biggest stake in the profits of the company."
